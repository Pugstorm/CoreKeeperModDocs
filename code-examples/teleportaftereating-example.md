  This is a mod which makes the player teleport in a random direction up to 50
  tiles around its' radius after eating anything in Core Keeper.

         * which disables burst for the entire group the system runs in which

         * again.

/*
 * This is another workaround for the problem with the job running with burst
 * since it starts after OnUpdate. This slows down the game since we wait for
 * all jobs to finish on the main thread, but more reliable since we
 * always guarantee that the job has started before we enable burst again at
 * the end of OnUpdate.
