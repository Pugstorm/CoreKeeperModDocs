  calls safely.

    // If we tried to run them in ECS which is where ShovelSlot.PlayDigEffects() runs, it would break.
    // So the Harmony patch just detects when ShovelSlot.PlayDigEffects() has finished and sets a flag to true,
    // and then the Update() method which runs every frame on the main thread checks that flag and runs our logic.
